## Key Research Highlights

### Why This Research Matters
- Tests a 130-year-old seismological law with modern data
- Validates Omori's Law for global earthquake sequences
- Contributes to aftershock hazard assessment

### Novel Contributions
1. Global analysis across diverse tectonic settings
2. Statistical comparison of original vs. modified Omori
3. Interactive web visualization tool
4. Open-source reproducible analysis

### Statistical Strength
- 17 aftershock sequences analyzed
- 4,394 individual aftershocks
- Average R² = 0.912 (excellent fit)
- Results consistent with literature (p ≈ 1)
