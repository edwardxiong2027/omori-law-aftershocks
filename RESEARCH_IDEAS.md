## Top 5 Unique Physics/Math Research Ideas

### 1. Benford's Law: Testing the "First-Digit Law" Across Scientific and Social Datasets
**Data Sources:**
- USGS earthquake magnitudes
- NASA asteroid diameters
- World Bank population/GDP data
- Stock market prices (Yahoo Finance)
- COVID-19 case counts

**Why It's Unique:** Benford's Law predicts first digits in natural datasets follow a logarithmic distribution (1 appears ~30%, 9 appears ~5%). Testing where it holds vs. fails reveals deep mathematical structure.

**Research Questions:**
- Which datasets obey Benford's Law and why?
- Can deviations indicate data manipulation or fraud?
- What mathematical conditions produce Benford-compliant data?

**Fun Factor:** High - reveals "hidden math" in everyday numbers

### 2. Verifying Kepler's Laws Using NASA Exoplanet Data
**Data Source:** NASA Exoplanet Archive (5,000+ confirmed exoplanets)

**Why It's Unique:** Use real astronomical data to verify centuries-old physics laws with modern discoveries

**Research Questions:**
- Does Kepler's Third Law (T² ∝ a³) hold for exoplanets?
- How do multi-planet systems compare to our solar system?
- Can we predict undiscovered planets from orbital data?

**Fun Factor:** Very High - space exploration meets classical physics

### 3. The Mathematics of Earthquake Aftershocks: Testing Omori's Law
**Data Source:** USGS Earthquake Catalog (millions of records)

**Why It's Unique:** Omori's Law (1894) predicts aftershock frequency decay - testing it with modern big data

**Research Questions:**
- Does aftershock decay follow Omori's power law n(t) = K/(c+t)^p?
- How do decay parameters vary by magnitude and region?
- Can we predict aftershock duration?

**Fun Factor:** Medium-High - important for disaster preparedness

### 4. Zipf's Law in Nature: From City Sizes to Word Frequencies
**Data Source:**
- US Census city populations
- Wikipedia word frequencies
- River lengths, lake areas

**Why It's Unique:** Zipf's Law (rank × size = constant) appears mysteriously across nature and language

**Research Questions:**
- What power-law exponent fits different domains?
- Why does this mathematical pattern emerge universally?
- How has the distribution changed over time?

**Fun Factor:** High - reveals universal patterns in seemingly random systems

### 5. The Physics of Music: Analyzing Harmonic Ratios Across Genres (Recommended)
**Data Source:**
- Spotify Audio Features API
- Million Song Dataset
- Music theory databases

**Why It's Unique:** Ancient Greeks discovered musical harmony relates to mathematical ratios - test this with big data

**Research Questions:**
- Do hit songs have different harmonic structures than non-hits?
- How have chord progressions evolved mathematically over decades?
- Do different cultures use different mathematical intervals?

**Fun Factor:** Very High - music + math = engaging
